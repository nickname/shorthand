Shorthand
=========

Shorthand is a zippy, keyboard-oriented notetaking app inspired by Notational Velocity.

It was written in Python using the PyGTK library.

Shorthand was designed to be a Linux equivalent of Notational Velocity, but should run with the correct libraries on Linux and Mac as well.

Please note that shorthand is still a very early prototype; there will be bugs! Do not use shorthand for anything critical, unless you make very careful backups.
